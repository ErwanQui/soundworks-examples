# `soloist` example application

> This example shows how to implement an a application composed of regular clients and of a dedicated controller client. This last client can trigger events (here visual, but could easily be replaced with audio) on all clients from a centralized interface that shows all the other clients on a map. The application makes use of the [`@soundworks/plugin-location`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-plugin-location).
